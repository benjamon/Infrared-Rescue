Carbon dioxide levels have increased 40% since the Industrial Revolution
CO2 is rising from fossil fuel burning (90%) and deforestation (10%)
Warmer air can hold more water vapor, amplifying the greenhouse effect
Fossil fuel burning releases over 100 times the CO2 as volcanoes
Higher greenhouse gas levels means the planet can’t cool as easily
The Paris Agreement (2015) aims to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions
The number of climate change related incidents have increase four fold between 1980 and 2010.
Land use change and deforestation contributes to 15% of carbon emission every year.
The climate change scenario was much stable before the industrial revolution and has been rapidly changing since then. Today the reality is that climate change is going to get worse than yesterday.
A separate budget of US$ 40 million has been allotted for climate change research since 1990.
Due to the greenhouse effect, the average temperature of the earth is 15 degrees rather than -18 degrees without the greenhouse effect.
Carbon dioxide constitutes only 3.6 % of total greenhouse gases out of which 0.12% is attributed to human activities.
Carbon dioxide is not the only contributing gas towards climate change. Other gases like methane and nitrous oxide are far more dangerous than carbon dioxide alone.
The ozone layer is in the stratosphere
CFCs and all other ozone-depleting substances are banned worldwide
The ozone layer protects us from harmful ultraviolet light
CFCs and leaded gasoline were both popularized by Thomas Midgley
One of the first uses of CFCs as a propellants was for DDT
CFCs and their replacement HFCs are both strong greenhouse gases
The ozone layer will recover from human damage in approximately 2060
The Montreal Protocol, signed in 1987, saved the ozone layerThe major weather systems on Earth are in the troposphere
The stratosphere was discovered in 1902 by Leon Teisserenc de Bort
Fast rising balloons were used to first discover the stratosphere
Temperatures stop decreasing with altitude in the stratosphere
The stratosphere is warmer because ozone absorbs radiation
Deserts are colder at night because the greenhouse effect is less
The mesosphere is a layer with intense vertical motion
